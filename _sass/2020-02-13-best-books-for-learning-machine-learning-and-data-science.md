<p>Here is a list of top books in the field of Machine Learning and Data Science. These books cover all the important topics and is an exhaustive list.</p>



<h2 class="section-heading">The List</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Mining Massive Datasets</li>
  <p>A great book for anyone who wants to understand how Big Data works.</p>
<li>Mathematics for Machine Learning</li>
<p>This book is a preparation for reading the next book in the list. This was taught to us in an introductory course at ANU in my first semester. The book gives great explanations on all the basics needed.</p>
<li>Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning</li>
<p>This is called the "bible" of Machine Learning for a reason. This book is a must read for anyone who wants to understand Machine Learning in-depth. This would be easy to understand and follow if you have read the previous one in the list.</p>

<li>Statistics for Machine Learning</li>
<li>Bayesian Methods for Hackers</li>
<li>Deep Learning</li>
<p>Covers almost everything. Great book.</p>
<li>Think Stats</li>
<li>Think Bayes</li>
<li>Data Just Right</li>
<li>Visual Storytelling with D3.js</li>
<li>The Nature of Statistical Learning Theory</li>
<li>Pattern Classification</li>
<li>ML - An Algorithmic Perspective</li>
<li>The Elements of Statistical Learning</li>
<li>ML - The Art and Science of Algorithms that make sense of data</li>
<li>Advanced Engineering Mathematics</li>
<li>Naked Statistics</li>
<li>Practical Statistics for Data Science</li>
<li>The Art of SQL</li>
</ul>

<p>I haven't added details of each book which I will in the future as I haven't read all the books. </p>
